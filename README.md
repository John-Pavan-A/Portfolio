# Portfolio
In this project you can learn how to create your own portfolio. It is a static website. You can easily edit and modify it using your code editor. After modifying it, if you would wish to make it available on the internet for others, you can easily do it using Amazon S3 bucket for free. If you are stuck anywhere in the process, please reach out to me.
